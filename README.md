# Cypress_findyourgrind
Repository containing a simple demo web UI tests of findyourgrind.com using Cypress.

Note that the demo also includes illustrations of how we can use Cypress native language and structure to write tests in Gherkin syntax WITHOUT using Cucumber plug-in, thereby reducing complexity and simplifying setup and maintenance of test code.

A video clip of the test running in Cypress can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nz_OCa1o6ss

A second video shows that Cypress you can run through the test results step by step and confirm that the tests have been run correctly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsdqTk7lygs
